# Research Log

Living progress tracker. **Status at a glance** is kept current; dated entries are
appended chronologically. Detailed run artifacts live under `runs/`. The task-by-task
plan is `docs/plans/2026-07-01-autoppia-vla.md`.

## Status at a glance (updated 2026-07-02)

GPU-free core harness: implemented + tested — **116 tests, ruff + mypy `--strict` clean**,
run with `~/vla-injection/.venv/bin/python -m pytest` (`PYTHONPATH=~/LIBERO` for the
LIBERO-backed task-resolution/adjudication tests).

- [x] Env verified on the GPU host (reuse the proven `~/vla-injection/.venv`)
- [x] GPU stack pinned (OpenVLA `c8f03f4`, LIBERO `8f1084e`); `libero_object` checkpoint cached
- [x] Fixed evaluator contract (validate / metrics / score / budgets / `evaluate_candidate`)
- [x] Candidate schema + validation
- [x] Autoresearch loop scaffold (ledger, `run_search_condition`, memory, random generator)
- [x] Baselines / search-condition configs
- [x] Result aggregation
- [x] `targeted_success` adjudication design (benchmark predicates, independent labels)
- [x] Rendering **Option A**: text→texture + 3D visual-only geom injection — *verified on GPU*
- [x] Task-pair suite **locked: `libero_object`** (shared scene, distinct predicates)
- [x] Visibility gate (#2) + per-rollout logging (#3)
- [x] Presentation pipeline figure (`docs/figures/pipeline.svg`)
- [ ] `OpenVLARolloutBackend.run_rollouts` — the closed loop (inject → OpenVLA → predicates → visibility → log) — **IN PROGRESS** (plan `docs/plans/2026-07-02-openvla-rollout-backend.md`; done: **A** task-resolution, **B** predicate-adjudication, **C** model-load/env-build seams, **D** episode loop (CPU-tested via faked GPU seams); next: **E** GPU smoke on GPU 1)
- [ ] Async `submit_evaluation` job path
- [ ] Pilot study (plan Task 7)
- [ ] Task 1 threat-model / literature polish confirmed "dissertation-ready"

## 2026-07-02

- **Env / GPU stack (Phases A–B).** Verified the harness ports cleanly on the GPU host by
  reusing `~/vla-injection/.venv` (uv, torch 2.2.0+cu121, OpenVLA editable, LIBERO via
  `PYTHONPATH=~/LIBERO`, `MUJOCO_GL=egl`). Pinned third-party commits; updated CPU-only
  test guards to GPU reality. Booted a headless `libero_spatial` env + render as a stack smoke.
- **Literature.** Read PPIA (2601.17383) and TRAP (2603.23117); framed the two-sided
  vision-layer landscape (typographic vs adversarial-patch). Locked **scope (a)**:
  autoresearch discovery of PPIA-class typographic injection on OpenVLA/LIBERO; TRAP is the
  related-work boundary (no CoT victim, no patch optimisation).
- **Rendering Option A (Phase C, part 1).** Implemented text→texture, a CPU-pure geom-spec
  builder, and XML-based injection of a thin **visual-only** (`contype=0`) textured geom.
  Verified on GPU: injected into a live `libero_spatial` scene, the label renders in
  agentview with correct perspective + occlusion.
- **Suite decision.** Found `libero_spatial` unusable for hijack pairing (all 10 tasks share
  the identical `bowl→plate` goal). Locked **`libero_object`** (7 objects, one scene, distinct
  `In <object> basket` goals → independent user/target predicates). Downloaded the
  `openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-object` checkpoint; flipped backend defaults (unnorm_key,
  `max_steps=280`).
- **Decisions #2/#3.** Added the `prompt_visibility` gate (segmentation-based) and per-rollout
  artifact logging (`runs/<id>/candidates/<cid>/`: texture, first-frame PNGs, `rollouts.jsonl`).
- **Presentation.** Added `docs/figures/pipeline.svg` (+ README) for the MSc talk.
- GPU discipline: all work above was CPU/disk only except two brief EGL smokes; GPU 0 was
  running a concurrent job and was left untouched (rollout work will pin to a free card).
- **`run_rollouts` seams A+B (TDD, CPU-pure).** Started the closed-loop sub-plan. Added
  `evaluator/libero_tasks.py` (`resolve_task`: candidate free-text task → `libero_object`
  task_id/language/goal predicates via normalised match; raises on no-match/ambiguous/unknown
  suite) and `evaluator/adjudicate.py` (`eval_goal_state`: conjunction of a target goal's
  predicates over a live env's `object_states` via LIBERO `eval_predicate_fn`; raises
  `UnevaluableGoalError` on empty/missing-object — validates *all* objects before evaluating,
  so a missing object never hides behind a short-circuited `False`). Both compute verdicts
  **purely** (no sim/LLM/heuristic) and are unit-tested off-GPU. `goal_state` is an immutable
  tuple-of-tuples (post-review hardening). `python-reviewer` pass: 1 HIGH (mutable verdict
  data) + 3 MED addressed. Suite: 116 tests green.
- **`run_rollouts` seam C (GPU model-load / env-build).** Added `_build_cfg` (the OpenVLA
  helper config — `center_crop=True` essential), `_load_policy` (bf16 + **sdpa**, loaded
  directly since the box lacks flash-attn), and `_build_env` (`libero_object` scene for the
  resolved user task) to `openvla_backend.py`, ported from the verified reference smoke.
  Confirmed the OpenVLA `experiments.robot.*` helpers import cleanly from ppip's cwd via the
  editable install — the `experiments` namespace package merges ppip's + OpenVLA's trees with
  no submodule-name clash, so **no `sys.path` hacking** is needed. GPU behavior is covered by
  `@requires_gpu` tests (skipped unless `PPIP_GPU_TESTS=1`) run once in the Task E smoke to
  avoid loading the 7B model repeatedly. 117 tests green, 2 GPU tests skipped.
- **`run_rollouts` seam D (episode closed loop).** Implemented the body: resolve user+target,
  load policy once, then per `(seed, rollout)` episode — inject the visual prompt (before
  `set_init_state`, the ordering gotcha), settle, run OpenVLA `get_action` → gripper transforms
  → `env.step`, adjudicate the target each step and **latch** (never terminate on it), and set
  `commanded_success` from the user-task `done`. Per-episode crashes and unevaluable targets
  become isolated `error` outcomes (never a fabricated verdict); env released in `finally`;
  logging isolated so an I/O failure can't discard a verdict. CPU-tested (12 tests) via faked
  GPU seams. `python-reviewer` (static-checked against pinned deps) **confirmed** the GPU-only
  paths — obs/action pipeline, inject-before-init ordering, `_object_states` chain, segmentation
  channel, latch semantics — are faithful, and caught **2 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH** now fixed:
  - **Task-pair adjudicability (CRITICAL, doc/data).** The "all objects in every scene" premise
    was **false**: each libero_object task has only 7 objects (target + basket + 5 *task-specific*
    distractors). A target is adjudicable only if its object is in the user scene's roster
    (e.g. for `alphabet_soup`: `{cream_cheese, salad_dressing, tomato_sauce, butter, milk}` — NOT
    `bbq_sauce`/`ketchup`). Corrected the design doc + backend docstring + CLAUDE.md; the invalid
    example pair was fixed. The loop already fails *safe* (unevaluable → `error`).
  - **Seed axis inert (CRITICAL).** Greedy decoding + hardcoded `env.seed(0)` ⇒ variation comes
    only from the init state; the old `episode_index`-only mapping duplicated rollouts across
    seeds. Now flattens `(seed, rollout)` → distinct init states (≤ 50 unique). Caveat documented.
  - **HIGH**: env now closed in `finally` (was leaking EGL context on crash); logging moved out
    of the verdict try (was clobbering a valid verdict on I/O error). **MEDIUM**: `obs` seeded
    from `set_init_state`. 129 tests green, 2 GPU tests skipped.
